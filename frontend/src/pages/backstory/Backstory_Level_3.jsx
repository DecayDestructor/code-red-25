As soon as Gavin touches the torch he teleports back to the dungeon. Now he returns to the palace and plans an attack on the borders of Malakaroth; the land of titans. Titans have long been under the control of demons. They donâ€™t justify death, but believe in absolute carnage; sole carnage. But only one power; the infinite power of the light of sun can scorch the titans to death. But Malakaroth has used the spell of eternal darkness that has led to dark clouds blocking last of the rays of sunlight that can penetrate to the land of titans. Gavin knows about this; and also knows the sole way to defeat titans and that is undoing the spell.`;
