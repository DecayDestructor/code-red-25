As fortune has it, the Ichorfonias is now operational, a powerful artifact brimming with spells designed to exploit the weaknesses of any foe. Each spell, however, requires a unique numerical code to activate.Among its arsenal lies a spell capable of altering time itself, shifting the world into evening. But Malakaroth, cunning as ever, ensured that the code for this critical spell is deeply concealed, hidden away from even the mightiest of demigods.The challenge now is clear: uncover the code, wield the Ichorfonias, and strike at the precise moment when Malakaroth is at his weakest.Time is of the essence.`;
