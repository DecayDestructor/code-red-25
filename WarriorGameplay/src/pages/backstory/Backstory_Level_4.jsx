To defeat them one enters a room that has a detonator to destroy the fortress or take help from Raven; Raven is a remaining member of the Elitos army who were slained by Malakaroth after they failed to capture Azgardos. You can also approach Raven to burn the whole stronghold using special fuel crafted by the Elitos army when they plundered and torched the civilization after the War of Gods.`;
